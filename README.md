  <p align='center'>         Hi, I'm Celeste! My journey into Software Engineering began with a
              simple thought, “If I knew how to code, I’d make an app for this.”
              Now, the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life is what
              keeps me motivated to write code. It's not just about the end
              product; it's the process of bringing an idea from concept to
              reality that truly excites me.
